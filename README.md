# AnimateForms

AnimateForms is a lightweight, async library for Windows Forms that provides an easy to use API. This library is inspired by the JS library [anime.js](https://animejs.com).

Currently, all that exists is just a direct implementation into a WinForms demo app, with some basic easings from [easings.net](https://easings.net) and equations for them from [gizma's easing page](http://gizma.com/easing/).

Stuff soon:tm:.
