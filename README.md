AnimateForms is a lightweight, async animation library for Windows Forms that provides an easy to use API. This library is inspired by the JS library [anime.js](https://animejs.com), and aims to implement some basic features similar to or functionally equivalent to that library.

### Where's v1.4.0a/1.0.0b?
The features are implemented already for these releases - however, the underlying method AnimateForms uses to execute animations is unstable and will require a rework for these features to be stable enough for actual usage. This would take significantly more effort than time I have right now - so these versions will be delayed.

# Installation, Usage, and Documentation

Complete code documentation is available [here](https://sdbagel.github.io/AnimateForms/). It includes methods and detailed descriptions on all aspects of the library. If something is missing, please create a pull request or an issue on this repository.

A beginner's quickstart guide can be found [here](https://sdbagel.github.io/AnimateForms/Quickstart/). This covers creating a new WinForms project, installing the library, and putting together a small application using AnimateForms and the tools it offers. 

Version numbers are marked on the documentation. Older versions of documentation and quickstart are available [here](https://sdbagel.github.io/AnimateForms/old).

# What's Next

Syntax of this library may change drastically throughout development. AnimateForms is simple enough that users can likely remain on older versions, but beware of this if you plan to develop a project using this library.
