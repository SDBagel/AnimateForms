AnimateForms is a lightweight, async library for Windows Forms that provides an easy to use API. This library is inspired by the JS library [anime.js](https://animejs.com), and aims to implement some basic features similar to or functionally equivalent to that library.

Due to general limitations with WinForms, not everything can be as cleanly ported over to this library as I would like, at least immediately. As such, syntax of using the library may change drastically over development in an attempt to make things as neat as possible.

# Installation, Usage, and Documentation

Complete code documentation is available [here](https://sdbagel.github.io/AnimateForms/). It includes methods and detailed descriptions on all aspects of the library. If something is missing, please create a pull request or an issue on this repository.

A beginner's quickstart guide can be found [here](https://sdbagel.github.io/AnimateForms/Quickstart/). This covers creating a new WinForms project, installing the library, and putting together a small application using AnimateForms and the tools it offers.
